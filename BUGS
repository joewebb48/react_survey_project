MAJOR BUGS
-- If I refresh the survay landing page (when i want to delete an options or question or survey) the code breaks becasue of the axios.get request.

BUGS
-- Logout wont redirect to the login page.
edit options doesnt type anymore..
cant figure out how to delete the survey from the admin landing page..(question List container)
-- not a bug.... but I want tab type to change to 2 when selectedQuestion is not null.
cant figure out how to change colors.
cant figure out how to do responsive design.
multiple choice buttons are always checked...
the background color of the over all App only goes down part way. why wont it go all the way to the bottom of the screen?
cant figure out how to seperatre the home page button and the logout button on in my Header container.
^^^ why arnt they buttons either? they can be clicked on. but dont act as buttons


ADDITIONAL THINGS I SHOULD DO...
-- change font for survey preview Title and Subtitle.
-- move everything to rtedux so it will update in real time.
-- or figure out another option to have things updagte in real time.
-- Add a Footer
-- Add a placeholder to the dropDown Question.



BEYOND MVP
-- Add individual link for 
-- Implimenting the Active Tab on SurveyItem
-- add the link to the survey on the SurveyItem
-- impliment Reports page for each additional survey
